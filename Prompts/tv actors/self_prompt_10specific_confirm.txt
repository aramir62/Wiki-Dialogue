description of <confirm>: A question trying to confirm an actor. In the response, ask for a confirmation of the given actor by referring to its attributes. Imagine that the actor's name has just been mentioned in the conversation, but you know of multiple actors with that name and want to verify if your friend meant the same one as you. The response should consist of a single yes/no question. Make sure you ask about the actor, not the attribute(s), nor the friend's opinion. In other words, a "no" answer to your question should mean that that is not the actor your friend had in mind, and not that the attribute is not true about the given actor.
