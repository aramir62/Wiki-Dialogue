The second will be a yes/no question verifying that your friend has the observed attitude towards all musicians of the same type (determined by the remaining given attributes). The value of the Liking attribute may be adapted to fit the justification better, but it must still express the same level of liking, e.g., "excellent" ~ "love", "average" ~ "decent"/"mediocre", or "poor" ~ "boring" (see examples below).
