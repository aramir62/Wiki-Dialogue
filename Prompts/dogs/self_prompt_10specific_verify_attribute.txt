description of <verify_attribute>: A response in which you verify whether your friend (dis)likes a certain type of dogs in general. In the response, state an observation about your friend's attitude to the given dog and then ask him or her whether it generalizes to all dogs of that type. The response should consist of 2 sentences: The first one will be the observation based on the Liking attribute and including the given dog's name. The second will be a yes/no question verifying that your friend has the observed attitude towards all dogs of the same type (determined by the remaining given attributes).
