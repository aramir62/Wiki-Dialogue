description of <suggest>: A question asking if your friend has any experience with a certain type of dogs. In the response, ask your friend if he or she has experience with a certain type of dogs, suggesting the given dog as an example of such a dog. The response should consist of a single yes/no question (possibly an indirect one, such as "I was wondering if..."), with the dog name at the end as an example. Make sure you ask about the general category of dogs corresponding to the given attributes, not the example dog directly, nor the friend's general opinion. In other words, a "no" answer to your question should mean that your friend has no experience or is not fond of such dogs, and not that your friend does not like the given dog.
