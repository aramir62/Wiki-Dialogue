description of <confirm>: A question trying to confirm an athlete. In the response, ask for a confirmation of the given athlete by referring to its attributes. Imagine that the athlete's name has just been mentioned in the conversation, but you know of multiple athletes with that name and want to verify if your friend meant the same one as you. The response should consist of a single yes/no question. Make sure you ask about the athlete, not the attribute(s), nor the friend's opinion. In other words, a "no" answer to your question should mean that that is not the athlete your friend had in mind, and not that the attribute is not true about the given athlete.
