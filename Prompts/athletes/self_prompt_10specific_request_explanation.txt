description of <request_explanation>: A question about why your friend (dis)likes a certain type of athletes. In the response, ask your friend for an explanation why he or she has the given sentiment about a certain type of athletes. Assume your friend has indicated his or her sentiment about the kind of athletes earlier in the conversation.

The response should consist of a single open-ended question about the type of athletes determined by the remaining given attributes. The value of the Liking attribute may be adapted to fit the justification better, but it must still express the same level of liking, e.g., "excellent" ~ "love", "average" ~ "decent"/"mediocre", or "poor" ~ "boring" (see examples below).
