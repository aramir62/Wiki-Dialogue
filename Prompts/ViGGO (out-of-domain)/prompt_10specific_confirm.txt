description of <confirm>: A question trying to confirm a {domain}. In the response, ask for a confirmation of the given {domain} by referring to its attributes. Imagine that the {domain}'s name has just been mentioned in the conversation, but you know of multiple {domain}s with that name and want to verify if your friend meant the same one as you. The response should consist of a single yes/no question. Make sure you ask about the {domain}, not the attribute(s), nor the friend's opinion. In other words, a ""no"" answer to your question should mean that that is not the {domain} your friend had in mind, and not that the attribute is not true about the given {domain}.
