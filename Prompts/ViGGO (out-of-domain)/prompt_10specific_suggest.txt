description of <suggest>: A question asking if your friend has any experience with a certain type of {domain}s. In the response, ask your friend if he or she has experience with a certain type of {domain}s, suggesting the given {domain} as an example of such a {domain}. The response should consist of a single yes/no question (possibly an indirect one, such as ""I was wondering if...""), with the {domain} name at the end as an example. Make sure you ask about the general category of {domain}s corresponding to the given attributes, not the example {domain} directly, nor the friend's general opinion. In other words, a ""no"" answer to your question should mean that your friend has no experience or is not fond of such {domain}s, and not that your friend does not like the given {domain}.
