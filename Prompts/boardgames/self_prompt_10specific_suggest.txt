description of <suggest>: A question asking if your friend has any experience with a certain type of board games. In the response, ask your friend if he or she has experience with a certain type of board games, suggesting the given board game as an example of such a board game. The response should consist of a single yes/no question (possibly an indirect one, such as "I was wondering if..."), with the board game name at the end as an example. Make sure you ask about the general category of board games corresponding to the given attributes, not the example board game directly, nor the friend's general opinion. In other words, a "no" answer to your question should mean that your friend has no experience or is not fond of such board games, and not that your friend does not like the given board game.
