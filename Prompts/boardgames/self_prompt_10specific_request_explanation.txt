description of <request_explanation>: A question about why your friend (dis)likes a certain type of board games. In the response, ask your friend for an explanation why he or she has the given sentiment about a certain type of board games. Assume your friend has indicated his or her sentiment about the kind of board games earlier in the conversation. The sentiment expressed in your response will thus be determined by the given value of the Liking attribute, not your own opinion. The response should consist of a single open-ended question about the type of board games determined by the remaining given attributes. The value of the Liking attribute may be adapted to fit the justification better, but it must still express the same level of liking, e.g., "excellent" ~ "love", "average" ~ "decent"/"mediocre", or "poor" ~ "boring" (see examples below).
