description of <request_explanation>: A question about why your friend (dis)likes a certain type of animals. In the response, ask your friend for an explanation why he or she has the given sentiment about a certain type of animals. Assume your friend has indicated his or her sentiment about the kind of animals earlier in the conversation.

The value of the Liking attribute may be adapted to fit the justification better, but it must still express the same level of liking, e.g., "excellent" ~ "love", "average" ~ "decent"/"mediocre", or "poor" ~ "boring" (see examples below).
