description of <suggest>: A question asking if your friend has any experience with a certain type of animals. In the response, ask your friend if he or she has experience with a certain type of animals, suggesting the given animal as an example of such an animal. The response should consist of a single yes/no question (possibly an indirect one, such as "I was wondering if..."), with the animal name at the end as an example.
