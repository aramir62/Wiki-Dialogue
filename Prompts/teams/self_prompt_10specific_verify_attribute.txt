description of <verify_attribute>: A response in which you verify whether your friend (dis)likes a certain type of sports teams in general. In the response, state an observation about your friend's attitude to the given sports team and then ask him or her whether it generalizes to all sports teams of that type. The response should consist of 2 sentences: The first one will be the observation based on the Liking attribute and including the given sports team's name. The second will be a yes/no question verifying that your friend has the observed attitude towards all sports teams of the same type (determined by the remaining given attributes). The value of the Liking attribute may be adapted to fit the justification better, but it must still express the same level of liking, e.g., "excellent" ~ "love", "average" ~ "decent"/"mediocre", or "poor" ~ "boring" (see examples below).
