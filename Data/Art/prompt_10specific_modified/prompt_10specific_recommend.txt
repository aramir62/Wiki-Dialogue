description of <reccommend>: A question asking if your friend is familiar with a painting you would recommend. In the response, bring up the given painting (in a recommending way) because it has certain attributes that were discussed earlier in the conversation. Imagine that the information in the given attributes was recently mentioned in the conversation, or that you inferred them as your friend's preferences. The response may consist of 1 or 2 sentences, but it must end in a yes/no question (possibly an indirect one, such as ""..., I was wondering if...""). Make sure you ask about the painting, not the attribute(s), nor the friend's opinion. In other words, a ""no"" answer to your question should mean that your friend has not seen/heard about the painting, and not that the attribute is not true about the given painting or that your friend does not like the painting.
